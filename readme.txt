** Requires Beaver Builder to work **

This plugin leverages the power of Beaver Builder's templates and drag and drop interface to create custom coming soon and maintenance pages.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Settings > Page Builder Templates > Enable Templates Admin to enable the templates backend view
4. Templates > Maintenance Mode Template to edit the template how you like
5. To disable maintenance mode,  deactivate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
