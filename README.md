Build a coming soon/maintenance page with Beaver Builder

upon activating the plugin a blank template should be created called "Maintenance Mode Template"

if you do not see the templates menu in your dashboard, you will need to enable them:

Settings > Page Builder
Templates > Enable Templates Admin

All you need to do then is open the template in Beaver Builder and design the layout as per normal Beaver Builder processes
